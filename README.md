# UkenChallengeUnity

UkenChallengeUnity is an update on an Unity Asset Store project named Trash Dash. This update changes the maximum lives the player can have as well as the starting amount. This also changes the amount of missions the player can have at once.

## Installation

Extract the file, open in Unity, this project requires an older version of Unity to run (I only found success with Unity 2020 variants)

## Usage

Playing the game through the Unity editor allows you to quickly access the game, by pressing the in-game button "Run" you can start through the tutorial if its your first time playing. The tutorial will give you a brief introduction to the mechanics.

Once  you complete the tutorial the game will open up to you and you will be able to access the "Missions" and "Shop" options, allowing you to check out the rewards store and any active missions. 

In the missions window you'll be able to scroll up and down to see the 4 available missions. Upon any instance of pressing the "Run" button you'll be able to see the newly changed 5 hearts instead of the default 3.

## Test Cases
Within the main file directory you will find a file named: "TrashDashTestCases.pdf". Upon opening this with your favourite PDF reader, you will find test cases for the core game-play loop using keyboard controls in windows.
